### Personal information
My home page: https://afu.itcode2018.cn

One likes to travel and loves the feeling of being on the road! Programmers who like folk music ~ (occasionally share some nice folk music with you, I will also recommend on this site, like you can pay attention to my NetEase cloud, collection of my own organized playlist: 勇敢迈出脚步)

### Personal introduction
Today do what others won't do, tomorrow do what others can't do!

### Future
A helpless and miserable programmer simply loves code...
